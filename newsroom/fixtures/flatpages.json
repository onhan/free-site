We focus on social justice stories in vulnerable communities. We want our stories to make a difference. When we uncovered corruption at the Department of Home Affairs, the department investigated it. When we reported that the streetlights in Khayelitsha were broken, the City fixed them. We don't only want to report the world; we want to change it.</p>\r\n<p>We value high-quality, ethical journalism. We are independent and do not promote any political party. Controversial news stories are fact-checked before they are published. We try to write in plain language. We also solicit and publish opinion pieces. We prefer opinion pieces that are fact-rich from people who work in the field about which they are writing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://groundup.org.za/journalists\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about</a> GroundUp's staff, freelancers and technical advisory board.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Support our work</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are almost entirely supported by donations.

We prefer to publish articles with the bylines of the people who wrote them, even if they wrote the article for an organisation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>\r\n<p>By default, we assert that all material published on GroundUp is our copyright. However, our copyright is very permissive. We almost always publish under a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">Creative Commons license</a>&nbsp;that allows anyone else to republish the article, so long as the author and GroundUp are credited, and the original article is not modified in any substantive way. We do this because we want articles we publish to be widely read. If you prefer an article you publish with us to be copyrighted or licensed differently, please negotiate this with us before, not after, publication. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Freelance news</strong></p>\r\n<p>Freelance reporters and photographers are welcome to submit briefs to us by email: <a class=\"spamspan\" href=\"mailto:info@groundup.org.za\">info@groundup.org.za</a>. A brief should be a paragraph explaining the story you wish to report. If we like the idea you have proposed we will discuss it with you and give you the go-ahead. All freelance articles must be accompanied by a photograph, preferably taken by you, that we can publish without breaching copyright. We also accept photo essays. We pay a small fee for freelance work if and only if we publish. The fees we pay from 1 December 2015 are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>R250 for a single photo</li>\r\n<li>R450 for a brief news article (approximately 450 words or less) with a photo&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>R900 for a full-length&nbsp;news article (approximately more than 450 words, but generally fewer than 800, and definitely fewer than 1,000) with a photo</li>\r\n<li>R1,500 for a simple feature including at least one photo, but preferably two&nbsp;(we make a judgment call on whether the feature is simple or complex, and our decision&nbsp;is final)</li>\r\n<li>R2,000 for a complex feature including at least one&nbsp;photo, but preferably two&nbsp;(we make a judgment call on whether the feature is simple or complex, and our decision&nbsp;is final)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>R900 for a simple photo essay, consisting of at least four photos&nbsp;(we make a judgment call on whether the photo&nbsp;essay&nbsp;is simple or complex, and our decision&nbsp;is final)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>R1,500 for a&nbsp;complex photo essay, consisting of at least four photos&nbsp;(we make a judgment call on whether the photo&nbsp;essay&nbsp;is simple or complex, and our decision&nbsp;is final)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Sometimes (not often) we are willing to negotiate a higher fee upfront with experienced reporters.</p>\r\n<p>We usually fact-check freelance contributions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Opinion</strong></p>\r\n<p>GroundUp gives preference to opinion pieces that are relevant to current news topics and interesting. Opinions on social justice issues are particularly welcome. Your article should be original and it should be clear to us that you actually know something about the topic you're writing about, and that you are not just armchair commentating. Try to keep your opinion piece between 600 to 1,000 words. We are less likely to publish very long articles unless they are extremely well written and engaging. Insults are not a good form of argument, so keep them to a minimum. Write in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/\">plain English</a>. Articles littered with waffle, hyperbole and strongly held but evidence-free opinions are unlikely to be published.</p>\r\n<p>We don't care if you use British or American English or split your infinitives. If you are a second-language English speaker, please don't be afraid to submit an opinion piece to GroundUp. We don't mind grammar errors and typos, so long as the article is coherent. We'll correct grammar and typos before publishing. But do note that articles that are unintelligible because of grammar errors and typos are unlikely to be read properly by our editors and therefore unlikely to be published.</p>\r\n<p>Avoid the current fashion in online journalism of substituting proper research with wordplay. We would prefer a dry opinion piece with concise intelligent arguments over one that uses wit to disguise vacuousness.</p>\r\n<p>If we decide to publish an opinion piece, expect to spend a bit of time on the phone or email with one of our editors, checking your facts and discussing ways to improve the text.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>We do not pay for opinion or analysis articles</strong> unless we explicitly commission them, which is rare. If we do commission an opinion or analysis&nbsp;piece, we may negotiate a payment with the writer.</p>\r\n</div>", "url": "/publish/", "title": "Publish with GroundUp", "registration_required": false, "enable_comments": false, "template_name": ""}}, {"model": "flatpages.flatpage", "pk": 6, "fields": {"sites": [1], "content": "<div>\r\n<p>If you have something thoughtful and interesting to say, please comment.

Most editors believe that there are an infinite number of places online for the public to express their points of view, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be on a specific news site, so it is up to the publication to determine the kind of conversation it wants to host.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>", "url": "/code-decency/", "title": "Comment policy", "registration_required": false, "enable_comments": false, "template_name": ""}}]
