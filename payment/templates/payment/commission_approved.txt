Dear {{commission.author.first_names}} {{commission.author.last_name}}

RE: COMMISSION APPROVED FOR ARTICLE - {{commission.article.title}}

A commission of R{{commission.commission_due}} has been approved for you.
The default tax rate we apply to this is: {{commission.tax_percent}}%.

Please send GroundUp an invoice.

Unless you have your own invoicing system, we recommend you fill in your invoice
using our form: https://goo.gl/forms/JPELMEoYIPu5wZ012

We pay on Tuesdays and Thursdays (unless they are public holidays) and try to
process invoices within seven days of receiving them.

This is an automated email sent by the GroundUp invoicing system.

Thank you.

DISCLAIMER

If the system has sent this email in error, we apologise. This email is not a
contract. If it contains the wrong amount or the GroundUp management decides
you are not owed commission by GroundUp, then that overrides this email.
